// I really tried to come up with a function on my own and I was pretty close but still needed to refer to colt to get the solution! Next time I think I can do it from memory...

function echo(str, num){
	for(var i = 0; i <= num; i++){
		console.log(str);
	}
}

echo("Echo!!!", 10)
echo("Tater Tots", 3)
